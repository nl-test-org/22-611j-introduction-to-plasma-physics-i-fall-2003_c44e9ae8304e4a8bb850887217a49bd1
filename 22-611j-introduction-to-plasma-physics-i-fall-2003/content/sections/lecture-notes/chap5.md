description: 'Note from Prof. Hutchinson: "These are transcriptions of the notes from
  which I teach the single semester course Introduction to Plasma Physics. Despite
  the heroic efforts (for which I am very grateful) to translate my hand-written materials
  into LaTeX, and extensive editing on my part, I don''t doubt that there are many
  typographical errors. Moreover, since they are only notes, don''t look for limpid
  prose, and realize that the detailed explanations are in my mind and orally in class,
  not all here."'
